      <p>hi there! This is an 'application' that 'renders' all of my (Josh) activity data that I've ever tracked in <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/38072598">Strava</a>.</p>
      <p>I'll write more about this some day on my 'main' website: <a href="https://josh.works">https://josh.works</a>. Add your email, feel free to follow along. You might come to regret the decision, but it's always easy to unsubscribe.</p>
      <p>Originally, I noticed friends having difficulty having an appreciation for exactly how widely I could range on my scooter. I was living in Golden, a suburb of Denver, and would ride my scooter in/out of Denver, sometimes. This always impresses locals. Eventually, I could just pull this page up and show them "not only do I do that trip, but look at all the other places I can go too..."</p>
      <p>I'm confident scooters have not yet reached the ideal level of utilization within American mobility networks, and I'm hoping to nudge that level upwards.</p>
      <p>For starters, zoom way out, see if you can find my scooter trip from Denver, Colorado, USA to Vernon, BC, Canada > Vancouver, BC > Seattle, Washington, USA > Denver, Colorado. <a href="/?latlng=43.58754359477899, -110.82163502087218">Here's where I stopped once along the way for Thai food (and gas) near Jackson Hole, WY,</a> on my way back to Denver. Zoom out. </p> 
      <p>When in the USA, I'm usually riding a scooter, and I happen to have a 170cc Lance Cabo 200. It's an adequate vehicle. There's lots of other similarly-sized scooters out there. Scroll down a bit for photos. These are all scooters I've ridden in the USA or Asia, of late. </p> 
      <p>I'll write more about it some day. I probably think you should get a moped and start riding around yourself.</p>

    <h3>Take a look at different places I've tracked my mobility data within, like:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=39.72927165246686,-105.00802723474892">Denver, Colorado, USA</a></li>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=-8.506786197265994,115.26236578460734">Ubud, Bali, Indonesia</a></li>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=47.60172493284988,-122.33900705633255">Seattle, Washington, USA. Two visits, different years, same friend, who lived in two different parts of the city, one of which was primarily ferry accessible, and, if you ask nicely, might take you sailing. I tracked my movement data anytime I was on a boat, scooter, feet, but not if in a car</a></li>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=19.36028774857446,98.44101216617672">Pai, Thailand</a></li>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=18.78535937701283,98.99485133328339">Chiang Mai, Thailand</a></li>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=25.049322875777623,121.5149019061664">a 24-hour layover in Taipai, Taiwan, containing train travel from the airport > city, scooter rental, touring around the city/night markets</a></li>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=27.71477455315837,85.31205826372452">a few days in Kathmandu, Nepal</a></li>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=40.76448082008763,-73.97905681018185">Amtrack-facilitated trip from DC -> NYC, USA</a></li>
      <li><a href="/?latlng=22.615623090684668,-83.71015545648831">üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è in Vi√±ales, Cuba</a></li>
    </ul>

    I'll maybe include more places later. 

    <p>I could write a book about Denver. I've travelled far and wide, across the city, I think. The last few years of my life has encompassed a few big moves, and a lot of travel. I was married, am no longer married, etc. I think this data is fascinating, it contains a lot of life lived.</p>

    <p>I've moved around Golden, Denver, and to Loveland, for a time, and spent a greater-than-usual amount of time in Asia.</p>

    <p>I note that the map is currently devoid of labels. It certainly is not often that we interact with maps, completely without references.</p>
    <p>All of this is data I've retreived from Strava, from when I first started using it to track some running I was doing.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I'd track more data, and then figured out I could easily-enough retrieve all of the data ever stored by Strava, rendered on a single, easy-enough-to-explore interface.</p>
    <p>There's years of data, and now obviously across a mode of travel methods.</p>
    <p>It's interesting. For example, <a href="/?latlng=39.72610779224126,-105.20863872171952">here's what the map looks like for the apartment building I lived in</a> for a few years, in Golden, CO.</p>
    <p>Since then, I've lived in a few different places, and spent days-to-weeks-to-months in many more, so there's many different spots of the world I've explored with an intensity most associated with 'walks daily around here'</p>
    <p>I've also tracked a few long scooter trips, and some train trips. I *think* I have very few, almost no, car trips. That's not exactly true, but a primary distinctive feature of this map is that it happened exclusively atop two-wheeled vehicles.</p>
    <p>Usually the vehicles looked something like the Lance Cabo, Genuine Buddy Kick, Nmax, PCX, Scoopy, and more:</p>
